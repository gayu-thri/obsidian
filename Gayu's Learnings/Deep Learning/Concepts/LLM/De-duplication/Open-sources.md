### SlimPajama
- De-duplication Type = Global de-duplication (within and between each data source)
- Algorithm used = MinHashLSH
- Algorithm briefing
	- Jaccard similarity threshold = 0.8
	- Document signatures constructed with pre-processed lowercase 13-grams
	- Pre-processing: 
		- Punctuation, consecutive spaces, newlines, tabs, and leading or trailing escape characters are removed
-  Limitations of vanilla MinHashLSH
	- Did not scale to trillion token datasets like RedPajama **(Ran out of memory)**
	- Solution:
		- Optimising memory usage
		- Parallelisation to perform de-duplication on 64 CPU cores with 1.4TB peak memory
		- Creating multiple MinHashLSH objects to query
