- Literature Review
	- FineWeb dataset - refined de-duplicated raw data; but has unsafe/unwanted text
	- SHED - Automated dataset refinement
		- selects most informative data
	- LLMClean - Automated data cleaning
		- ==Rule-based== & ML-based cleaning tools
	- Conclusion
		- Existing work focus on leveraging tools for data curation
		- Doesn't address regular automated filtration - AI safety
- Proposals
	- The system also filters data from untrusted sources, even if the data appears safe
